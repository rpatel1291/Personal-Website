# Personal Website
Using what I have learned during two web programming courses, I wanted to practice by creating and designing a responsive website using Express, Handlebars, Bootstrap/custom CSS and JavaScript to showcase academic projects

## To start the application run the following code:
```javascript
  npm install //This will install all dependencies
  npm start //This will run the application and will be avaiable on http://localhost:3000/
````
